The Source Data we are using was of size more than 600MB so we have provided the link to the source from where the data can be downloaded. This project makes use of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which was designed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to receive reports concerning vaccine-related adverse events. Medical practitioners are urged to report adverse events, and VAERS data may include coincidental events that are unrelated to the vaccine.In addition, due to the human factor in data input, we should expect incomplete examples.
