        "When analyzing VAERS data, keep in mind that no cause-and-effect relationship has been proven for any reported occurrence. VAERS receives reports of all possible links between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects). As a result, VAERS collects information on any adverse event that occurs after immunization, whether it is coincidental or actually caused by the vaccine. A report of an adverse event to VAERS is not proof that the occurrence was caused by the vaccine.\n",
        "\n",
        "* VAERS is a passive reporting system, which means that reports of adverse events are not collected automatically and must be reported to VAERS. Anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, and family members, can voluntarily submit VAERS reports. The quality and completeness of reports varies. They frequently lack details and, on sometimes, may provide inaccurate information.\n",
        "\n",
        "* One of the major drawbacks of passive monitoring systems, such as VAERS, is \"underreporting.\" The phrase \"underreporting\" refers to the reality that only a tiny percentage of genuine adverse events are reported to VAERS. The extent of underreporting differs greatly. For example, many of the millions of immunizations given by injection each year induce pain, yet only a small percentage of these instances result in a VAERS report. Minor side effects of vaccines often include this type of soreness, as well as low fevers, as physicians and patients are aware. Serious and unexpected medical events, on the other hand, are more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after immunization, even if they are unrelated to the vaccine.\n",
        "\n",
        "* A report to VAERS does not always imply that the indicated vaccine(s) were to blame for the adverse event. It merely validates that the alleged occurrence happened after the vaccine was administered. VAERS will accept the report without requiring confirmation that the occurrence was caused by the immunization. VAERS accepts all reports without determining if the vaccine was to blame."
